config: dict
"""
Dictionary of hub configuration variables.

You can override its default values in ``boot.py`` or add your own entries. This dictionary is accessible to all of your programs until you reboot the hub.

The values in ``hub.config[]`` are evaluated in the following order of increasing priority:

1. Default value as described below. Note that there will be no corresponding entry in ``hub.config[]``

2. If the file ``/etc/hub_config`` exists and has no syntax errors then it is evaluated and may update or create values in ``hub.config[]``.

3. If the file ``boot.py`` exists and has no syntax errors then it is evaluated and may update or create values in ``hub.config[]``. After evaluating ``boot.py`` the one-time post boot initialization happens.

4. If the file ``main.py`` exists and has no syntax errors then it is evaluated and may update or create values in ``hub.config[]``.

5. Any user supplied file or console commands may override an entry in ``hub.config[]``.

By default ``hub.config[]`` has the following entries:

* ``hostname``: Identifies the hub in various places such as Bluetooth advertising. This value is read from ``/etc/hostname``.

* ``lwp_advertise``: Configures whether the firmware should control BLE advertising using the LEGO Wireless Protocol. A positive value enables advertising after the given duration (ms) after boot. Set to 0 to disable advertising.

* ``bt_discoverable``: Configures whether the hub should be discoverable with Bluetooth classic. A positive value makes it discoverable after the given duration after boot. Set to 0 to disable discoverability.

* ``disconnect_behavior_enabled``: If ``True``, hub shuts down automatically after some time if no Bluetooth connection is made.

* ``lwp_bypass``: If ``True``, the firmware will not process LEGO Wireless Protocol commands. It is False by default.

* ``disable_usb_poweron``: If this key exists, the hub will not start up again if USB is connected after shutdown.

* ``powerdown_timeout``: Sets the inactivity timeout (ms) before the hub shuts down. Set to ``0`` to disable automatic shutdown.

* ``device_get_can_return_float``: Configures whether a device (sensor or motor) returns an integer or float as a result of executing the ``get()`` method. Default value is ``False``.

def file_transder(

) -> None:
    """
    Prepares a file transfer to the hub.

    After calling this function, press ``CTRL+F`` or send ``\x06`` to start the actual transfer. Bytes sent after this will be written to the specified file on the hub. Once the transfer is complete or fails, the REPL resumes control.

    Auto-detection of transfer interface (USB or Bluetooth) is enabled. The first interface that receives a good package within the specified timeout, will be used for the rest of the transfer.

    Parameters
        filename: Absolute path to the file. The containing folder must already exist.

        filesize: Size of the file to be transferred, expressed as a number of bytes. The size must not exceed the remaining amount of storage space.

        packetsize: Size of each packet. The packet is not written until it is received in full.

        mode: String with optional file transfer settings. Choose ``'a'`` to make the hub send ``ACK`` or ``NAK`` after each packet. Doing so is recommended for USB transfers but not for Bluetooth Classic transfers.

    Raises
        OSError (ETIMEDOUT): If the transfer was started but the expected data was not received within the timeout.
